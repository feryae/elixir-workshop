- Elixir was designed for building scalable and resilient application
- Elixir is a functional programming language
- On arch linux `sudo pacman -S elixir`
- You can type `iex` for live interactive Elixir
- You can concatenate string by doing this `"hello" <> " world"`
- Mix is the build tool in elixir
- To create a new project with Mix -> `mix new example`
- To compile -> `mix compile`
- To run -> `iex -S mix` and then for example call the function `Example.hello`
- Alternative run -> `mix run -e "Example.hello"` -> the return value will not be automatically printed though.
- To Print do `IO.puts()`
- You can define on application level what function should be executed by default on `mix.exs`
- Hex is elixir's package manager.
- To get started do `mix local.hex`
- To install dependencies go to `mix.exs`, paste the version on deps and do `mix deps.get`
